## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to ORBIT. We develop the new open-source medical standard for the world. We are happy that you joined the team to build this future together. 
We are building the software infrastructure that no one wants to build because of economics and technical complexity. This leaves people in need without 
any good healthcare. 

## How is ORBIT making this?
ORBIT is a software that closes the gap from collecting the dataset, pre-processing, annotation, model development, clinical testing/trials, 
algorithm approval, and deployment. ORBIT does this while maintaining to be very light, fast, and customizable. It could be installed on servers or 
on the edge. Moreover, it comes with security and data ownership features built into it. ORBIT will be offered as a cross-platform software on 
iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, and the Web.
